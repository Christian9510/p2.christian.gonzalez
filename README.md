###### To get a C, you need to
  1. Provide the Sketch of your interface.
  2. Include the general information in your sketch: personalized calendar, news feed, text messages, social feed items, clock, and weather.
  3. Include the health-related information in your sketch: sleep, weight, exercises, and mirror time.

  B. General Information: Calendar, News Feed, Clock, Weather, etc.
     <br />a) Calendar - I have provided a calendar, implemented through a csv file, in which when you press the button, it will bring up my calendar from many rows and have        7 values (Date,Year,Workout,Classes,Eat,Freetime,Work).
     <br />b) New Feed - The images in the lower left hand corner are from CNN, these images are cycling and will change every 10 seconds. The link are stored in a csv file          and when you click on the hyperlink, they will take you to the main news article under the specific categories.
     <br />c) Clock - A nice digital clock has been implemented in the top right hand corner, it is NOT military time, so when it hits PM, it will stay as 1-12, not 13-
     <br />d) Weather - The weather in the top left hand corner gives the current weather in your area, as the API used                                                              (https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/LUB/48,32/forecast/hourly).
  
  C. Include the health-related information in your sketch: sleep, weight, exercises, and mirror time.
    <br /> a) Sleep - Sleep Time has been added within the Health-Related Information section.
    <br /> b) Weight - Weight has been added within the Health-Related Information section.
    <br /> c) Exercises - Exercises have been added as their own section, as checkboxes give the user a chance to check off what exercises they have completed for the day.
     <br />d) Mirror Time - Mirror Time has been added as its own section, as a csv has been use to show this.

###### To get a A, you need to:
  1. Implement one of the advanced features.
  2. Provide your github report page and 2-minute presentation video.
  3. Please pay attention on the overal design and layout, and usability of your final interface.

  Some advanced features include:
     <br />a) Allow the user to customize the display - e.g. the widget sizes and locations (drag and drop items in the desired location on the screen).
     <br />b) Voice command: play music when you are brushing your teeth or in the shower - how do you control the playlist?
     <br />c) Act as a light source (with different possible colours).
     <br /> d) Your imagination.

  A. Implement one of the advanced features.
    a) An advanced feature I have included was the drag and drop items in desired locations, as the user can drag and drop the lego man's head onto the body.
    b) Another advanced feature I have included I have used was my imagination, as having my images in the lower left hand corner cycle every 10 seconds on their own,     along with the checkboxes as well.
    
  B. Provide your github report page and 2-minute presentation video.
    a) My github report page is this readme file, as combining the report along with the mirror had issues like repositioning my designs/graphics.
    b) My 2-minute presentation video is below: <br />

  C. Please pay attention on the overal design and layout, and usability of your final interface.
    a) All designs, layouts, and usabilities within this mirror have been tested and paid attention.
